# Introduction

Hey, I'm Sage :) I also go by Sky, I'm 19 years old.



I have worked with, and am working with (in order):
- Java
- HTML & CSS & js
- Batch
- MS-DOS & BASIC
- Visual Basic Script
- Visual Basic
- C#
- Node.js & TypeScript
- C++ / C
- x86 Assembly

I'm still learning most of these, have taught all of the aforementioned myself,
over the course of 6 years, but would rather consider myself a half-decent google user, than a good programmer.

This profile was created for the purpose of me uploading some code, and share it more easily
